        If you do not know whether you make sickle hemoglobin, you can find out by having your blood tested. You may also have 
        a genetic test. This way, you can learn whether you carry a genes  — or have the trait — for sickle hemoglobin that you
        could pass on to a child.
        {'\n\n'}
        Genetic tests can help your doctor figure out which type of sickle cell disease you have or can help confirm a diagnosis
        if results from blood tests are not clear. Genetic testing can also tell whether you have one or two copies of the sickle 
        hemoglobin gene.

        Healthcare providers can also diagnose sickle cell disease before a baby is born. This is done using either a sample of 
        amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding a growing embryo) or a sample of tissue taken from the placenta 
        (the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the womb).
        {'\n\n'}
        Testing before birth can be done as early as 8 to 10 weeks into the pregnancy. This testing looks for the sickle 
        hemoglobin gene rather than the abnormal hemoglobin itself. This testing cannot tell you how severe the disease symptoms will be.
        <Header newSection={true}>Newborn screening</Header>
        In newborn screening programs, healthcare providers prick the heel of the newborn and collect drops of blood on a special 
        type of paper. The hemoglobin from this blood is then tested in a lab. Newborn screening results are sent to the provider 
        who ordered the test and to your child’s healthcare provider.
        {'\n\n'}
        Providers from a special follow-up newborn screening team will contact you directly if your child has sickle cell disease. 
        Your child’s providers will then retest your child to make sure the diagnosis is correct.
        {'\n\n'}
        Newborn screening programs also find out whether your baby has the sickle cell trait and is a carrier. If this is the case, 
        counseling will be offered. Remember that when a child has sickle cell traitexternal link or sickle cell disease, their future 
        siblings or your child’s future children may be at risk.
